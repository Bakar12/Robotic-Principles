# Robotic Principles 

## Assignment Details
**Module Name:** 5ELEN018W Robotic Principles  
**Instructor:** Dr. Dimitris C. Dracopoulos  


## Submission Overview
This submission contains the required files for the Robotic Principles coursework, which involves modeling and controlling a car towing a trailer using Simulink. The submission includes:

1. **Simulink Model of the Dynamic System**:  
   This file contains the block diagram model of the car-trailer system based on the given dynamic equations.

2. **Simulink Model with PID Control**:  
   This file extends the dynamic system model with a PID controller to regulate the car's speed according to the specified profile.

3. **Analysis Report**:  
   A concise 3-page report that discusses the modeling and control implementation, including PID tuning, step response, Bode diagrams, and system stability analysis.

## Instructions for Use

1. **Simulink Models:**
   - Open the `.slx` files in MATLAB Simulink.
   - Run the simulations to observe the dynamic behavior of the car-trailer system and the effect of the PID controller.
   - Modify parameters in the PID controller if necessary and re-run the simulations to see different outcomes.

2. **Analysis Report:**
   - The report is provided in PDF format.
   - It contains explanations of the simulation results, choice of PID parameters, and a discussion on system stability and performance.
